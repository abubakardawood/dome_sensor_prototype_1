Bill of Materials:
1. 3D printer
2. PLA filaments
3. Polymer Optical Fibres (https://www.pofeska.com/pofeskae/product/02/index.html), 2-3 meters
4. M5 screws, 4pcs
5. EcoFlex 00-50 (https://www.benam.co.uk/ecoflex-00-50)
6. Syringe without needles 1 pc
7. Silicone Glue Silpoxy (https://www.benam.co.uk/sil-poxy)
8. Keyence Optoelectornic system

Fabrication:

1. 3D print the mould files provided in the solidworks files folder.
2. 6 inches long piece of plastic fibre was passed through the two holes of 'Silicone_Mould_Top_Notch' such that it follows the curvature of the dome shape, when both the mould parts are closed. (https://www.pofeska.com/pofeskae/product/02/index.html)
3. Use 5mm screws to close both the mould parts.
4. Mix EcoFlex 00-50 part A and B and vaccuum it.
5. Use syringe to inject the silicone into the mould, and vaccuum the mould again to extract any entrapped air bubbles.
6. Leave the mould for 3-4 hours at room temperature for silicone to cure.
7. Open the mould and take the silicone dome out of mould.

Assembly:
1. The pair of optical fibres (emitter and receiver) are inserted into the centre holes of the 3D printed 'Dome holder'.
2. A 4mm Pneumatic pipe is also inserted into the dome holder and glued.
3. The silicone dome taken out of the mould is glued using Silpoxy to the dome holder.
4. The setup is ensured to be leakproof by putting the assembly in water and presurizing the dome.
5. The dome_holder is put on the 3D printed stand_cylinder for the experimentation.
